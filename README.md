The dataset used in this study is also available (AVM_demersalSharks.csv).

### Scripts available
*1_Preparing_dataframe*: Data organising.

*2_Obtaining_Enviro_data*: Downloading data from CMEMS and ERA5 and extracting the enviromental data to the surveyed points.

*3_Subsetting_Checking_data*: Conduct pre-fitting checks on data to ensure BRT applicability.

*4_Fitting_brt*: Fitting BRT models to predict at-vessel mortality (AVM) for demersal sharks using biological, enviromental and fishing operation drivers.

*5_Plots*: Create study map and raincloud plots as data summaries. 

*Appendix 1*: theoretical recommendations and training on BRT fitting
